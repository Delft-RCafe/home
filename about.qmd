# Join the TU Delft R Café!{#sec-joinrcafe}

Are you learning R or looking for a friendly community to practice with? The R Café is a welcoming space for R users of all levels—from absolute beginners to experienced programmers. 

We’re a group of R enthusiasts from across the TU Delft community who meet monthly to to explore R together, troubleshoot code, share tips, and learn from each other in an open and informal setting. 

Whether you're asking "*Why should I use R?*" or "*Why isn't my code working?*", you'll find support and encouragement here.

We meet in-person or in an online sessions. See below for upcoming dates and registration links. While we're always happy to welcome walk-ins, we appreciate pre-registration—this helps us run the event smoothly. 

Our initiative was inspired by Utrecht University’s R Café now [Programming Café](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/walk-in-hours-workshops/programming-cafe).

# Who can join?{#sec-who}

Everyone is welcome! You don’t need any prior experience with R—whether you're just getting started or want to share advanced tips and tricks, there's a place for you at R Café. Many of our members have recently completed a Data Carpentry workshop and are looking for a space to keep practicing, while others bring years of experience and and want to share their awesome tips and tricks (e.g., about an R package, type of analysis, or visualization) with others!

If you're curious about R and want to learn in a supportive, hands-on environment, join us!

# What to expect?{#sec-what}
Our monthly meetups usually have a theme, explored through:

- Short presentations or demonstrations by members
- Hands-on exercises to practice R coding
- Group discussions where we learn from each other
- Live coding sessions using RStudio

If you have an R-related question—whether it's about your project, data analysis, or a tricky bug—you’re welcome to bring it to our meetings!

To get the most out of the R Café, we suggest that you bring your laptop with R and RStudio installed. You can find details on installing R and RStudio in the [Resources](#sec-res) section below - please let us know if you need any help.
