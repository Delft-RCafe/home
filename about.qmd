# Join the TU Delft R Café!{#sec-joinrcafe}

We’re a group of R enthusiasts from across the TU Delft community who meet monthly to discuss questions from the very broad *Why should I use R?* to the hyper-specific *Why is my code not working?!*


Together we make up a supportive community of practice for researchers to share knowledge and learn with each other in an open and informal setting.

If you plan to join online, please pre-register so that we can order enough refreshments. See below for upcoming dates and registration links, and make sure to update your registration if you can’t make it.


Our initiative was inspired by Utrecht University’s R Café now [Programming Café](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/walk-in-hours-workshops/programming-cafe).

# Who can join?{#sec-who}

The R Café is open to anyone who works in R or is interested in learning. No prior experience with R is necessary - all are welcome!

Many of our members have recently completed the Data Carpentry workshop and are looking for a space to continue practicing R skills with others. You can also join if you’ve got plenty of R experience and want to share some awesome tips and tricks (e.g., about an R package, type of analysis, or visualization) with others! 


To get the most out of the R Café, we suggest that you bring your laptop with R and RStudio installed. You can find details on installing R and RStudio in the [Resources](#sec-res) section below - please let us know if you need any help.
 

# How do R Café meetings run?{#sec-how}

Our monthly meetings usually have a theme which we can touch upon by brief presentations by one or more of our members, exercises for us to work through, a group discussion, or some combination.


We take a hands-on approach to work through problems and always have RStudio open for live coding.

If you have an R-related question or challenge that is specific to your project, we are happy to discuss in any of our meetings. If your question requires a lot of context, it’s helpful if you can send us an email with details before the meeting.

## Tidytuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a project in 
which a real-world data set is posted to social media weekly. 
Everyone is welcome to explore and analyse the data. The result can be posted to 
social media with the #tidytuesday hashtag. At TU Delft R Café, we can get together 
to work on the tidy Tuesday data together!

You will find  some examples of analysis in the [TidyTuesday](tt/tidytuesday.qmd) section.
