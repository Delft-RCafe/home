## About Plot-a-thon 

Are you venturing into the world of R programming and seeking a challenge to elevate your skills? Perhaps you find yourself finetuning your data visualizations a tad too often? Do you yearn to express your creativity while unraveling data's mysteries?

Join us for the first TU Delft R Café Plot-a-thon: a data visualization challenge!

### Who can participate?

The event is dedicated to the TU Delft community. So if you study or work at TU Delft, you’re welcome to participate! The competition is open to R users of all proficiency levels!

You can register individually or as part of a group. If you prefer joining a group but don't have one in mind, don't worry—we can match you with other solo R enthusiasts searching for their pack!

### What’s the challenge?

In this thrilling challenge, you will dive into the world of statistics from the [4TU.ResearchData repository](https://data.4tu.nl/). Once you register, we'll provide instructions on how to access the data and submit your work.

### How to participate?

The tool of choice for this challenge is R! You must upload your visualizations along with the R code that brought them to life, accompanied by a brief description of your project. The rest is limited only by your imagination!
