## About Plot-a-thon 

Are you venturing into the world of R programming and seeking a challenge to elevate your skills? Perhaps you find yourself finetuning your data visualizations a tad too often? Do you yearn to express your creativity while unraveling data's mysteries?

Join us for the first TU Delft R CafÃ© Plot-a-thon: a data visualization challenge!

### Who can participate?

The event is dedicated to the TU Delft community. So if you study or work at TU Delft, youâ€™re welcome to participate! The competition is open to R users of all proficiency levels!

You can register individually or as part of a group. If you prefer joining a group but don't have one in mind, don't worryâ€”we can match you with other solo R enthusiasts searching for their pack!

### Whatâ€™s the challenge?

In this thrilling challenge, you will dive into the world of statistics from the [4TU.ResearchData repository](https://data.4tu.nl/). Once you register, we'll provide instructions on how to access the data and submit your work.

### How to participate?

The tool of choice for this challenge is R! You must upload your visualizations along with the R code that brought them to life, accompanied by a brief description of your project. The rest is limited only by your imagination!

### Whenâ€™s the deadline?

### Grading Criteria 

Here are the main criteria we will use to grade the data visualizations.
 
| criterion/score | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| information | The information on the visualisation is not accurate. It is unclear what the visualisation is supposed to depict. | The information in the visualisation is mostly accurate and can be fully understood with the aid of a presentation. | The information on the visualisation is accurate and easily understood without additional information from the creator. Labels, legends, and axes are clearly labeled. |
| visual appeal | That's nice... | Not bad! | Ooooh pretty! | ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© |
| analysis | Limited data wrangling. No comments provided in code. | Good use of data wrangling to access additional trends in the data. Limited comments provided. | Great use of data wrangling to access information within the dataset. Great use of comments to guide the reader through the code | |
| reproducibility | Visualisation required more than three interventions to reproduce. | Visualisation reproducible with two or three interventions. | Visualisation reproducible with only a single intervention. | Fully reproducible with no intervention. Works on Linux (Ubuntu), MacOS, and Windows. |

### What's next?
After the submission, you are invited to join our grand finale - the  Showcase Event, where we invite you to present your work and to join the award ceremony. Please remember to save the date on **Wednesday, 11th October, 3PM  at Orange Room, TU Delft Library**.

## R Starter Kit

### Setup R and RStudio

To complete the challenge, you will need to work with R. You can use it with a code editor of your choice,but if you donâ€™t have a preferred code editor, consider using RStudio, which provides a number of useful features to help your project be well organized.
Please go through [setup instructions](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/#setup-instructions) on how to install R and Rstudio, depending on your operating system.

### Create an RStudio Project

This step is not necessary, but will help you organize your work better. If youâ€™re working with RStudio, you can create a project that encapsulates all your work associated with Plot-a-thon in one place. Read the [instructions on how to create a new project](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/00-intro.html#create-a-new-project). 

### Load dataset to R 

To work with the dataset weâ€™ve sent you, you will need to load it to your working environment. There are a few ways to do this in R. You can read a [csv file using `read.csv()` function](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/11-supp-read-write-csv) available in the installation version of R. 
You can also opt for making use of some add-on packages, for instance very widely used `tidyverse` package(s). Then, you would [read data with `read_csv()` function](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/02-starting-with-data.html#importing-data). 

The choice is yours!


### R data visualization packages & resources

R has some built-in functions to visualize data. But oftentimes, you might want to use packages that are curated specifically for data visualization. Here are some examples of packages that you might find useful: 
 
 * [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - graphics library, based on grammar of graphics framework
 * [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) - interactive graphics
 * [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) - interactive maps
 * [`dygraphs`](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) - interactive time-series graphics

To get you started with visualizations in R, follow the [Data Carpentry episode](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/05-ggplot2.html) on data visualizations using `ggplot2`.


For further reading, look at some [resources on data visualizations in R](https://delft-rcafe.github.io/resources/#data-visualisation), gathered by TU Delft R CafÃ©. 


## FAQ

### How big should the groups be?

There is no limit to the group size.

### Can I skip the Showcase event?

At least one person from the group needs to be present at the Showcase event to present your work. Also, you wouldn't like to miss it!

### I have just started to learn R. Can I still join?

Sure! You will learn plenty from the challenge, and we will assist you once you get stuck!

### Will you provide food and drinks during the event?

Yes! The refreshments will be provided! We also have cool goodie-packs ready for you!

### How will my work be assessed?

The data visualizations will be assessed by independent judges, using a number of assessment criteria, e.g. data analysis, visual design, reproducibility. The full grading rubric will be shared with with you together with the data visualization assignment.
