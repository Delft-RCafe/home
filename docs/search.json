Perhaps you find yourself finetuning your data visualizations a tad too often? Do you yearn to express your creativity while unraveling dataâ€™s mysteries?\nJoin us for the first TU Delft R CafÃ© Plot-a-thon: a data visualization challenge!\n\nWho can participate?\nThe event is dedicated to the TU Delft community. So if you study or work at TU Delft, youâ€™re welcome to participate! The competition is open to R users of all proficiency levels!\nYou can register individually or as part of a group. If you prefer joining a group but donâ€™t have one in mind, donâ€™t worryâ€”we can match you with other solo R enthusiasts searching for their pack!\n\n\nWhatâ€™s the challenge?\nIn this thrilling challenge, you will dive into the world of statistics from the 4TU.ResearchData repository. Once you register, weâ€™ll provide instructions on how to access the data and submit your work.\n\n\nHow to participate?\nThe tool of choice for this challenge is R! You must upload your visualizations along with the R code that brought them to life, accompanied by a brief description of your project. The rest is limited only by your imagination!\n\n\nWhenâ€™s the deadline?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmission deadline\n\n\n\n9th October 2023, 12PM\n\n\nYouâ€™ll have two weeks to submit your visualizations before the showcase event on October 11th from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM.

However, the showcase event, where you present your work will be hosted in the inviting Orange Room at the TU Delft Library.\n\n\nWhy join?\nThere are plenty of reasons to jump aboard:\nData visualization with R is fun! Youâ€™ll learn, and youâ€™ll help others learn too! The winner will have their visualization featured on the 4TUResearchData repository website. There are additional exciting prizes up for grabs!\n\n\nWhat are the prizes?\n\n\n\nPlace\nPrize\n\n\n\n\n1st Place\nâ‚¬300 cash prize\n\n\n2nd Place\nâ‚¬200 cash prize\n\n\n3rd Place\nâ‚¬100 cash prize\n\n\nAudience Pick\nâ‚¬200 cash prize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWinner will have their data visualization featured on the 4TU.ResearchData repository website!! \n\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\nShould you encounter any challenges during the competition, there are numerous ways to ask for help.\n\nJoin self-help MS Teams channel\nIf youâ€™re stuck with a data visualization channel, post your question in the Plot-a-thon self-help Channel, for other participants and organizers to answer. Like that we learn together!\n\n\nDrop by online info session\nIf you would like to meet us and ask questions live, join the Q&A drop-in session online. The session will take place on Wednesday, 27th September, 12:45 - 13:45.\n\n\nSend us an email\nIf you have questions about the challenge or organization, you can always reach out to us at rcafe-lib@tudelft.nl for support!\n\n\n\n\n\nShowcase event agenda\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading Criteria\nHere are the main criteria we will use to grade the data visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncriterion/score\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\ninformation\nThe information on the visualisation is not accurate. It is unclear what the visualisation is supposed to depict.\nThe information in the visualisation is mostly accurate and can be fully understood with the aid of a presentation.\nThe information on the visualisation is accurate and easily understood without additional information from the creator. Labels, legends, and axes are clearly labeled.\n\n\n\nvisual appeal\nThatâ€™s niceâ€¦\nNot bad!\nOoooh pretty!\nðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©\n\n\nanalysis\nLimited data wrangling. No comments provided in code.\nGood use of data wrangling to access additional trends in the data. Limited comments provided.\nGreat use of data wrangling to access information within the dataset. Great use of comments to guide the reader through the code\n\n\n\nreproducibility\nVisualisation required more than three interventions to reproduce.\nVisualisation reproducible with two or three interventions.\nVisualisation reproducible with only a single intervention.\nFully reproducible with no intervention. Works on Linux (Ubuntu), MacOS, and Windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatâ€™s next?\nAfter the submission, you are invited to join our grand finale - the Showcase Event, where we invite you to present your work and to join the award ceremony. Please remember to save the date on Wednesday, 11th October, 3PM at Orange Room, TU Delft Library.\n\n\n\nAll the participants of the Plot-a-thon are invited to participate in the Showcase event. During this event, youâ€™ll present your work, and weâ€™ll feature an engaging keynote speech while announcing the challenge winners!\n\nDate: Wednesday, 11th October 2023\nTime: 3PM â€“ 6:30PM CEST\nPlace: TU Delft Library, Orange Room\n\n\nAgenda\n\nKeynote speech (3:00 PM - 3:20 PM)\nShort keynote speech about data visualisations in R.\n\n\nPlots presentations (3:20 PM - 4:00 PM)\nParticipants will shortly present their visualizations.\n\n\nCoffee break (4:00 PM - 4:15 PM)\nDuring the break we will vote for our favorite visualizations!\n\n\nAwards Ceremony (4:15 PM - 4:30 PM)\nAnnouncement of the jury pick for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. We will also reveal the audience pick winner!\n\n\nMeet & mingle (4:30 PM - 6:30 PM)\nNetworking event\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup R and RStudio\nTo complete the challenge, you will need to work with R. You can use it with a code editor of your choice,but if you donâ€™t have a preferred code editor, consider using RStudio, which provides a number of useful features to help your project be well organized. Please go through setup instructions on how to install R and Rstudio, depending on your operating system.\n\n\nCreate an RStudio Project\nThis step is not necessary, but will help you organize your work better. If youâ€™re working with RStudio, you can create a project that encapsulates all your work associated with Plot-a-thon in one place. Read the instructions on how to create a new project.\n\n\nLoad dataset to R\nTo work with the dataset weâ€™ve sent you, you will need to load it to your working environment. There are a few ways to do this in R. You can read a csv file using read.csv() function available in the installation version of R. You can also opt for making use of some add-on packages, for instance very widely used tidyverse package(s). Then, you would read data with read_csv() function.\nThe choice is yours!\n\n\nR data visualization packages & resources\nR has some built-in functions to visualize data. But oftentimes, you might want to use packages that are curated specifically for data visualization. Here are some examples of packages that you might find useful:\n\nggplot2 - graphics library, based on grammar of graphics framework\nplotly - interactive graphics\nleaflet - interactive maps\ndygraphs - interactive time-series graphics\n\nTo get you started with visualizations in R, follow the Data Carpentry episode on data visualizations using ggplot2.\nFor further reading, look at some resources on data visualizations in R, gathered by TU Delft R CafÃ©.\n\n\n\n\nHow big should the groups be?\nThere is no limit to the group size.\n\n\nCan I skip the Showcase event?\nAt least one person from the group needs to be present at the Showcase event to present your work. Also, you wouldnâ€™t like to miss it!\n\n\nI have just started to learn R. Can I still join?\nSure! You will learn plenty from the challenge, and we will assist you once you get stuck!\n\n\nWill you provide food and drinks during the event?\nYes! The refreshments will be provided! We also have cool goodie-packs ready for you!\n\n\nHow will my work be assessed?\nThe data visualizations will be assessed by independent judges, using a number of assessment criteria, e.g.Â data analysis, visual design, reproducibility. The full grading rubric will be shared with with you together with the data visualization assignment."
