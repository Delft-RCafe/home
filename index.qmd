# Why R?{#sec-whyr}


Did you know that with R, you can clean and process your research data, conduct a wide range of statistical analyses, create publication-quality figures, and save scripts that allow you to reproduce your work with the push of a button – all using just one program!

R is a programming language that is popular in both academia and industry for its broad functionality and approachable learning curve. R and supporting tools are open-source and totally free, making it easy to find resources developed by a global community of users. No matter which discipline you work in, you’re likely to find packages and tutorials targeted toward the types of analyses you want to run, and resources that make it easy to get started or “unstuck”. You can also develop your own packages for specific purposes in your research and publish them for others to use. 


Do you want to build your skills in the programming language R, write R code with others, or ask questions about working with R? Check out some examples of the many cool things you can build with R! 

## Fun with R

During R Café meetings, we're trying out different tools and types of analysis. Here's a small sample of what we've been working on:

```{r}
#| label: word-cloud
#| fig-cap: "Words used in IDE master theses: word cloud created with `wordcloud2` package"
#| code-fold: true


# Load library wordcloud2
library(wordcloud2)

#Load data
wcloud_data <- readRDS(here('data', 'wcloud_data.RDS'))

# Define colors 
tud_blue<-'#00A6D6'
mycolors <- c( rep(tud_blue,6),rep('#000000',1000))

# Create a word cloud
set.seed(12345)
wordcloud2(wcloud_data, size = 0.7, color = mycolors)
```
