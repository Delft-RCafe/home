See below for upcoming dates and registration links, and make sure to update your registration if you can‚Äôt make it.\n\n\nOur initiative was inspired by Utrecht University‚Äôs R Caf√© now [Programming Caf√©](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/walk-in-hours-workshops/programming-cafe).\n\n# Who can join?{#sec-who}\n\nThe R Caf√© is open to anyone who works in R or is interested in learning. No prior experience with R is necessary - all are welcome! \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Artwork by @allison_horst](img/monsteRs.jpg)\n:::\n\nMany of our members have recently completed the Data Carpentry workshop and are looking for a space to continue practicing R skills with others. You can also join if you‚Äôve got plenty of R experience and want to share some awesome tips and tricks (e.g., about an R package, type of analysis, or visualization) with others! \n\n\nTo get the most out of the R Caf√©, we suggest that you bring your laptop with R and RStudio installed. You can find details on installing R and RStudio in the [Resources](#sec-res) section below - please let us know if you need any help.\n \n\n# How do R Caf√© meetings run?{#sec-how}\n\nOur monthly meetings usually have a theme which we can touch upon by brief presentations by one or more of our members, exercises for us to work through, a group discussion, or some combination.\n\n\nWe take a hands-on approach to work through problems and always have RStudio open for live coding. \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](img/pizza2.gif)\n:::\n\nIf you have an R-related question or challenge that is specific to your project, we are happy to discuss in any of our meetings. If your question requires a lot of context, it‚Äôs helpful if you can send us an email with details before the meeting. \n\n<!--Because we know our audience, we offer a *unique*  combination of ‚òï and  üçï.-->\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Want to get involved?\n\nGot a favorite topic you‚Äôd like us to explore, or an idea for a presentation at an upcoming R Caf√©?
